1. Batch Data Processing- Hours, day, week, month or even year (just wait for minimum threshold time )->Hadoop, Hive and Apache spark are helpfull 

2. Near Real Time-> more than 30s, 1m or 2 min not a completely real time but this is near real time (at least wait for few seconds)

3. Real Time Data Process- Instantly-> ->Bank Transaction
                                       ->Application for live cricket scores and aggregations
                                       -> Gaming application (live Tournaments)
                                       ->Trending twiter hastags
                                       ->Any type of real time dashboards exampla are stock exchange, live count in a mall
Kind of messaging system which can help us to hold the data. Messaging queses for real time processing- (hold the data for real time process.)
 -> Messaging queues-whatever even we are producing, whatever event are getting generated 
 ->kafka messaging system for stream processing-> Whenever there is a system where records are coming in the real time we call it as a stream processing(Stream means continuous flow of data)

Source App -> DB-> Kafka-> Process Engine for real time analysis->dump data for somewhere -> Destination-> Dashboard
Kafka->3 components majorly
      1. Producer
      2. Consumer
      3. Connector

Producer are writing the data into the kafka->publishing the data. The producer 
Consumer are reading the data from the kafka queue ->Consumers basically subscribes which are subscribing one specific space within the kafka and just listening the records from the specific kafka queue.
Kafka component: 
              1. Broker
              2. Topics
              3. Partitions
              4. Replicas
              5. offsets
              6. Commits- syncronous and asyncronous
              7. consumer Groups
              8. Parallalism in kafka
              9. Back Pressure
Kafka Architecture: Its also one kind of cluster. Cluster-> The combination of multiples commodity hardwares connected over the networks so that it will acts as a single machine.
In a cluster there will be a multiple those comodity hardwares which are eventually call as a server.
