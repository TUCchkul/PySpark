1. Batch Data Processing- Hours, day, week, month or even year (just wait for minimum threshold time )->Hadoop, Hive and Apache spark are helpfull 

2. Near Real Time-> more than 30s, 1m or 2 min not a completely real time but this is near real time (at least wait for few seconds)

Kind of messaging system which can help us to hold the data. Messaging queses for real time processing- (hold the data for real time process.)
 -> Messaging queues-whatever even we are producing, whatever event are getting generated 
 ->kafka messaging system for stream processing-> Whenever there is a system where records are coming in the real time we call it as a stream processing(Stream means continuous flow of data)

Source App -> DB-> Kafka-> Process Engine for real time analysis->dump data for somewhere -> Destination-> Dashboard
Kafka->3 components majorly
      1. Producer
      2. Consumer
      3. Connector
